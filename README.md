# haskell-road-to-logic-excercises

This repository contains the implementation of excercises from the book "The Haskell Road to Logic, Math and Programming" by Kees Doets and Jan van Eijck ([official website](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/d.j.n.vaneijck2/HR/)).

It also contains unit tests of which implementation was part of getting my head around unit testing in Haskell.
